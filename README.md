===============

All of the code from my article on a Laravel Gulp setup. (http://christoph-rumpel.com/2014/02/how-to-laravel-series-lets-talk-gulp/)
Node modules have been removed. If you want to use this asset gulp structure:

1) Clone this repository to a folder called "assets" in you laravel public folder

2) Make sure Gulp is installed globally (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)

3) Install all required node modules which are defined in package.json

    npm install
    

3) Run gulp

    gulp
